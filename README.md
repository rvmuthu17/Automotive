To build a circuit for your XFlash hazard indicator system for a bike using an Arduino, you’ll need to interface the Arduino with the bike’s indicator system (left and right turn signals). Below is the circuit and wiring suggestion:

Components Required:
Arduino (e.g., Arduino Nano or Uno)
Transistor (e.g., NPN transistor like 2N2222) or MOSFET (e.g., IRF540N) for driving the high-current load of the indicators
Bike’s indicator lights (left and right)
Resistors (1kΩ for base of transistor/MOSFET gate, 220Ω for Arduino pin protection)
Flyback Diodes (e.g., 1N4007) to protect from voltage spikes when controlling relays or inductive loads
Indicator control pins from the bike (left and right indicator switches)
Power supply for Arduino (if the bike’s electrical system isn't providing 5V, you may need a 12V-to-5V regulator)
Optional: Relay for higher current handling
Basic Circuit Description:
Arduino and Transistor/MOSFET Setup:

The Arduino will control the indicators using its GPIO pins, but since the indicator lights typically draw more current than the Arduino can provide directly, transistors or MOSFETs are used to switch the high current to the lights.
Left indicator pin (Arduino pin 2) will control the left indicator light using a transistor.
Right indicator pin (Arduino pin 3) will control the right indicator light in the same way.
Transistor (e.g., 2N2222) Connection:

The Arduino pin (2 for left, 3 for right) connects to the base of the transistor through a 1kΩ resistor.
The emitter of the transistor connects to ground (GND).
The collector connects to the negative terminal of the indicator light.
The positive terminal of the indicator light connects to the 12V supply.
Use a flyback diode (1N4007) across the indicator light for protection in case of inductive load (even though most lights will not need one, it is recommended for protection).
Powering the Arduino:

If your bike uses a 12V electrical system, you will need a DC-DC step-down converter (12V to 5V) to power the Arduino, as it runs on 5V.
Ground (GND) from the bike's electrical system should be connected to the Arduino's ground and also to the ground of the indicator lights and transistors.
Controlling the Indicator:

When the Arduino pin (2 or 3) is set HIGH, it will drive the transistor into conduction, allowing current to flow through the indicator light, turning it on.
When the pin is LOW, the transistor will turn off, and the indicator will be off.

Key Points in the Circuit:
Transistor (2N2222) or MOSFET (IRF540N):

The NPN transistor acts as a switch. The Arduino controls the base to allow current to flow from the 12V supply through the indicator light and the transistor to ground.
Alternatively, you can use MOSFETs, especially if you need to handle more current.
Flyback Diode:

This protects the transistor or MOSFET from voltage spikes when switching inductive loads, like relays (even if indicator lights are resistive, it’s still good practice).
Powering Arduino:

You’ll need to step down the bike's 12V supply to 5V to power the Arduino. A DC-DC converter like LM7805 or any 12V-to-5V buck converter will work.
Indicator Switches:

The indicator switches on the bike (which are typically connected to the left and right indicator wires) will trigger the sequence by controlling the state of the indicator pins.
Indicator Lights:

The indicator lights are connected directly to the 12V system and are controlled by the Arduino through the transistor (or MOSFET). The transistor handles the switching of higher current that the indicator lights require.
Simple Power Distribution:
Bike 12V Supply:
The bike's electrical system usually supplies 12V DC. Connect this to both:
The 12V pin of the DC-DC converter to step down to 5V for Arduino.
The positive terminal of the indicator lights (through the transistors/MOSFETs).
Grounding:
The GND of the bike’s system should be connected to both the Arduino GND and the indicator lights' GND side.
Using Relays (Optional):
If you want to control larger indicator lights that draw more current than your transistor or MOSFET can handle, you can use relays. The Arduino will drive the relay coil, and the relay will control the high-current indicator light circuits.

Relay Wiring:
The relay coil is controlled by the Arduino pin (through a transistor if necessary).
The NO (Normally Open) terminal of the relay connects to the positive terminal of the indicator light.
The common (COM) terminal of the relay connects to the 12V supply.
The indicator light’s negative terminal connects to ground.
Final Note:
Before you finalize the installation, make sure to test the system in a safe environment (i.e., the garage) to ensure all connections are working as expected. Additionally, ensure that all components are capable of handling the current drawn by your bike's indicators. If you're unsure about the power ratings, it's always good to consult the specifications of your indicator lights and use appropriate MOSFETs or relays.
